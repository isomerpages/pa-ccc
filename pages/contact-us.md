### About CitizenConnect
The Citizen Connect Centres (CCCs) have been enhanced and is now known as CCC+ to better cater to the needs and provides residents with free access to internet-enabled hardware such as LAN-Terminals at 7 ServiceSG@CCs/ Centres and 25 Community Clubs/ Centres.  These are to enable citizens who do not own internet-enabled devices to be able to transact with Government services online at the CCs. 

Some of the government transactions that can be done at CCCs include:<br>
•	Viewing of CPF Statements<br>
•	Registering and paying for activities organised by Community Centres or Clubs<br>
•	Booking sports facilities via Sport Singapore<br>
•	Applying or renewing HDB/URA season parking tickets<br>
