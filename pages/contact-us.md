<h3>About CitizenConnect</h3>
<p>Located at Our Tampines Hub and 25 community centres island-wide, the Citizen Connect Centres (CCCs) provide an easy and convenient means for citizens to transact with the Government online. The CCCs offer free access to Internet-enabled computing devices, with trained staff present to assist and teach users to perform online transactions.</p>

<p>Examples of the transactions that can be done at CCCs include:</p>

<li> Viewing CPF statements</li>
<li> Registering and paying for activities organised by Community Centres or Clubs</li>
<li> Booking sport facilities via Singapore Sports Council</li>
<li> Applying or renewing HDB/URA season parking tickets</li>
</br>
<p>As part of on-going enhancements to make it easier for citizens to self-help, all the CCCs have been upgraded to enhanced CCCs (also known as CCC+) to better cater to the needs of the elderly and people with special needs. These enhancements include touch screen interfaces and a more intuitive landing page.</p>
